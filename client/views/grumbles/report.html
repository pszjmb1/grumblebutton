			<p>This form can be used to report issues that may affect the quality of patient care and the maintenance of the hospital. By identifying normally unreported issues, this system hopes to reduce risk and save money.</p>
			<p>It is recommended that you only write about one issue per report for simplicity reasons (e.g., if you need to report about a puddle on the floor and a broken lightbulb in the same room, you would make one report for the puddle and another for the lightbulb). For extra information about the study, please visit <a href="{{pathFor 'modifyAccount'}}">this</a> page.</p>
