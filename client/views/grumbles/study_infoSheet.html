			<h1>Information Sheet for Participants</h1>

				<p>This research is performed through the Horizon Digital Economy Research Hub at the University of Nottingham, funded by Research Councils UK.</p>	
				<p style = "text-align:justify"><br>Patient care is directly affected by a myriad of factors including lack of staff, poor management, inappropriate treatment, poor hygiene, lack of equipment, wrong care decisions, and poor communication. Capturing the breadth and depth of all these factors using current systems is almost impossible and consequently many of these factors are never reported. </p>
				<p style = "text-align:justify"><br>Identifying unreported risks and internal and external factors affecting workload, with feedback to employees from the correct management team, will impact positively on service design, staff education, training, welfare & development and potentially reduce risk and save money. The Sayit.Today project, being developed jointly by Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute at The University of Nottingham, and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has developed a mobile platform for reporting minor issues. We are bringing together a broad range of disciplines, including computer science, human factors, positional engineering, and health sciences, to investigate how hospital services can be enhanced by ubiquitous digital technologies. This study aims to collect data on hospital service improvement through the use of the Sayit.Today minor issue reporting system. We want to determine whether Sayit.Today will make it faster, easier and more transparent for staff and management to communicate about minor issues related with the service quality of the hospitals.</p>
				<p style = "text-align:justify"><br>The study will run for a month at City Hospital and QMC. If you decide to participate you will be asked to report minor issues during this time at your convinience through a web interface accessible on your work PC or mobile phone. These issues will be displayed in a password protected website that you and your fellow participants will have access to. For each issue you can choose to hide or reveal your identity for the issue appearing on the website, however please note that the database will still record your user name with the issue record for auditing purposes. Reporting an issue should usually only take a couple of minutes (although it can take longer depending on the level of detail you choose to provide). In addition, we will provide a short training session (up to 20 minutes) to explain how best to use Sayit.Today, and may ask to interview you prior to study commencement (up to 20 minutes). At the end of the study we may ask to interview you (up to 30 minutes) or ask you to answer a feedback questionaire.</p>
				<p style = "text-align:justify"><br>The issues you report will be sent weekly to Dr. Dominick Shaw for responding to. In addition the project team at Horizon will review the issues and your interview/survey responses to help improve Sayit.Today.</p>
			
				<p><br><b>PARTICIPATION IN THIS STUDY IS VOLUNTARY – YOU DO NOT NEED TO TAKE PART; YOU MAY LEAVE THE STUDY AT ANY POINT WITHOUT GIVING A REASON WHY.</b> If you choose to leave the study all data relating to you and your involvement will be deleted.</p>

				<p><br><b>DATA FROM THIS STUDY WILL NOT BE USED TO EXAMINE THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL STAFF MEMBERS OUTSIDE THE RESEARCH CONTEXT OR FOR DISCIPLINARY PURPOSES.</b></p>

				<p style = "text-align:justify"><br>Data from this study will be held in a secure and safe manner in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. It should be noted that it may be possible to identify you from your data and responses. Data from this study will be used to generate project reports and academic publications – however steps will be taken to anonymise issue reports for any such uses of data. The data will be stored for the duration of the project on password protected systems and accessed only by staff working directly on the project. This data will be retained for a period of at least seven years from the date of any publication which is based upon them.</p>
